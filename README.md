Creating a visualization between the air quality of Vancortlandt Park, along with monthly temperature readings in surrounding areas, to determine the correlation between these variables and Arthropod Abundances/Observations. 
By using data from the NYC Open Source Database, alongside iNaturalist, I'm applying knowledge from libraries like Pandas to clean and organize my dataframe of information (merging data frames together based on columns), and 
using other libraries such as matplotlib/plotly to create these visuals.
